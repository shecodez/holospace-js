# HoloSpace
### the final 'chat' tier

I do not believe __VR__ (Virtual Reality) is the final frontier in communication just because it rhymes well and I'm a Star Trek nerd.

VR as we know it today is... *clunky*. To me it is synonymous as calling those self-balancing two-wheeled rolling devices "Hoverboards" when they clearly do __not__ hover at all.

Right now VR requires a large *clunky* headset, joysticks, and umm... a lot of *imagination*.

Now all that being said, __warning__: this project is very much so a WIP, and has so many ISSUES *I need a whole darn box of tissues*

HoloSpace will be upon release *clunky*, but hopefully not as much as VR is currently today.
I'm not a mechanical engineer but I have some hardware ideas that if possible could bring the system closer to what I imagine would be a true VR experience.

### Issues (I am aware of)

- [ ] The VR channel chat room is currently just 3D and not VR ready yet.
- [ ] Voice communication doesn't work well if at all.
- [ ] Resizing the canvas in a VR channel makes the canvas UI non-responsive.
- [ ] It's slooooow!
- [ ] Security. What security!?
