### the final 'chat'tier

### Live Demo

The application is hosted on Heroku. Check out the live demo at https://holospace.herokuapp.com

## My Thoughts

I do not believe **VR** (Virtual Reality) is the final _chat_ tier (frontier) in communication just because it rhymes well and I'm a Star Trek nerd.

VR as we know it today is... _clunky_. To me it is synonymous as calling those self-balancing two-wheeled rolling devices "Hoverboards" when they clearly do **not** hover at all.

Right now VR requires a large _clunky_ headset, joysticks, and umm... a lot of _imagination_.

Now all that being said, **warning**: this project is very much so a WIP, and has so many ISSUES _I need a whole darn box of tissues_

HoloSpace will be upon release _clunky_, but hopefully not as much as VR is currently today.
I'm not a mechanical engineer but I have some hardware ideas that if possible could bring the system closer to what I imagine would be a true VR experience.

### Issues (I am aware of)

-   [ ] The VR channel chat room is currently just 3D and not VR ready yet.
-   [ ] Voice communication doesn't work well if at all.
-   [ ] Resizing the canvas in a VR channel makes the canvas UI non-responsive.
-   [ ] It's slooooow!
-   [ ] Security. What security!?
